## Introduction ##

Dive into the world of MATLAB coding to simulate or calculate certain physical phenomena in our universe. MATLAB code is run through Octave. The software that displays written MATLAB code.

Some MATLAB codes, I worked on when I was an undergraduate at the University of Missouri-St. Louis (UMSL). One of the differences between MATLAB and Python is MATLAB uses semi-colons.

### Example ###

Using MATLAB to help understand the temperature, pressure, and density of carbon inside an Asymptotic Giant Branch Star (AGB) within the red-giant star phase on the H-R diagram. During third dredge up the AGB star is pushing out carbon from its core, the carbon passes through the photosphere region several times, like hail in a thunderstorm or the pistil in an internal combustion engine. Then, the carbon becomes dense enough where radiation pressure ejects the carbon from the photosphere and into deep space. As the carbon mass tumbles through space, it collides with other materials, like carbon, to form a carbonaceous chondrite. After millions or billions of years (human time scale) later, the carbonaceous chondrite crashes on a planet that will become a blue planet. The carbon will be used in the creation of biological life from tiny single celled organisms to large complex organisms, like humans.
